# Projects

Showcase of various open source and Web Platform engineering work I've done.

**[React Native iOS app for WLPN 105.5 Chicago](https://github.com/jhabdas/lumpen-radio)**

Open source iOS native app using React Native. Geared toward easing the barrier to entry for non-profits and other <abbr title="Low-Power FM">LPFM</abbr> broadcast radio stations. [Learn more](https://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/low-power-fm-broadcast-radio-stations-lpfm) about LPFM.

**[Brunch with Panache](https://travis-ci.org/trunkclub/brunch-with-panache)**

Isomorphic <abbr title="Rapid Application Development">RAD</abbr> toolkit empowers developers, designers and product owners to quickly develop single-page Web applications without going off the rails. Used to power enterprise E-commerce, operations and merchandising applications. But simple enough to build one-off apps. Created entirely using JavaScript and Node.js. Supports TDD, integration testing, quarter-second page loads and sub-second builds. Integrates with React.
