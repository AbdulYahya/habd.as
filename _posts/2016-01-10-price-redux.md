Looking back on learning to code originally, it started when I played script kiddie back in the mid-90's using [AOHell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOHell).[^1] But getting a hold of scripts like that to play with meant getting closer to the warez scene on EFNet, which is where I started picking up parts of my [first scripting language](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2812). But rather than tell you the yawn-inducing story of how I learned to create a successful ratio-driven FTP dumpsite and wire it to an eggdrop reporting real-time race stats on IRC[^2], I want to instead tell you about what it costs to learn Redux. Which really means the price of simply learning to code.

Why? Because after seeing a prominent Chicago JS-related Meetup mail blast hundreds of people for a 2-day paid Redux training (they never show the prices up-front) I feel compelled yet again[^3] to tell anyone with a desire or passion to code what it costs to do so.

So, without further adieu, ladies and gentlemen, the price of learning to code, without restriction, I'm fairly certain, is somewhere close, close to the amount of:

> Learning to code is free.

Yep, that's right. Plain and simple. As in, doesn't cost any money F-R-E-E free.

Now your left-brain might be thinking _that's not entirely true_. And, if so, you're right: it's not entirely truthy. You might need to buy some hardware to get started. But if you know [where to look](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) chances are you have that much change in your couch. No monitor? Just start asking. Probably most of us know someone looking to get rid of an old LCD monitor.

So, for those looking to learn Redux, I encourage you to save your hard-earned dollars, download a Redux-flavored seed from my post [Awesome React Boilerplates](/awesome-react-boilerplates/), spend a few hours watching Dan Abramov's excellent and free [Getting Started with Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux) video tutorials, review a [curated list of Redux links](https://github.com/markerikson/react-redux-links) to help guide your learning, use [my dotfiles](https://github.com/jhabdas/dotfiles) to get your coding environment in shape, and just start pounding on that keyboard. You'll go from script kiddie to kid genius for less than you'd pay in late fees at the public library.
