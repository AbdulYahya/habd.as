When I started this blog back in 2008 I didn't have a clear direction for what I wanted it to be. I just knew at the time I was working on closed source software and, without it, had no other way to convey my skills to potential employers and clients. And though it doesn't seem so long ago, it's crazy to think that GitHub was founded the same year.

Over time the direction of this blog became more clear. It eventually grew to become a tech tutorials site and [made open source](https://github.com/jhabdas/habd.as). It serves as a journal both for the community and a place for me to scribe how to do things I knew I'd forget otherwise. It worked, and has served both purposes well.

After **deciding to leave the corporate world** earlier this year in favor of working with startups, individuals and small enterprise as a freelancer I realized this site was not the proper place to tell that story. And so I **created a new website** to start documenting the freelance journey. The new website name was inspired by [Ean Platter](https://github.com/eanplatter) during our time together at TechnologyAdvice, and is called [Hack Cabin](http://hackcabin.com).

Please check out the new site if you're interested in gaining your independence in the way you work. And if you're a developer doing on closed source development, consider starting your own blog. You'll find a blog a great creative outlet, and good way to improve your writing and software development skills. And, as an added bonus, you'll also get a warm fuzzy every time you find out others are benefiting from your work as well--even if you're not getting paid for it.

To the road ahead, wherever it may lead. Onward ho!
