When I started this blog back in 2008 I didn't have a clear direction for what I wanted it to be. I just knew at the time I was working on closed source software and, without it, had no other way to convey my skills to potential employers and clients.

Over time the direction of this blog became more clear. It eventually grew to become a tech tutorials site and [made open source](https://github.com/jhabdas/habd.as). It serves as a journal both for the community and a place for me to scribe how to do things I knew I'd otherwise forget. It worked, and has served both purposes well.

After deciding to leave the corporate world earlier this year in favor of a path less conventional I realized this site was not the proper place to tell that story. And so I created a **new website to start documenting the freelance journey**. The new website name was inspired by one [Ean Platter](https://github.com/eanplatter), curator of the fantastic [React Newsletter](http://reactjsnewsletter.com/), during our time together at TechnologyAdvice--it's called [Hack Cabin](http://hackcabin.com).

Hack Cabin is a static website built using AWS and Hugo. [Read about the site architecture](http://hackcabin/post/initial-commit/) and why I suggest others [Choose Hugo Over Jekyll](/choose-hugo-over-jekyll/).

And if you're not interested in technology I'll also be writing about travel and freelancing on Hack Cabin. So check it out if you're interested in [gaining independence](https://medium.com/@andco_26266/welcome-to-your-independence-the-go-to-guide-for-freelancers-7b1f405f5aee) in the way you work, and quietly slipping away from your corporate overlords.

To the road ahead, wherever it may lead.
