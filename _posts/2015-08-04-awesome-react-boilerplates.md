Not interested in reinventing the wheel? Neither am I. Here's a short list of awesome React boilerplates for getting React-based applications off the ground in a hurry. These application templates were not taken from any list, however awesome <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome">that list</a> might actually be. Rather, they've gained enough mindshare to find me outside [*The Stream*](https://medium.com/matter/the-web-we-have-to-save-2eb1fe15a426). They're open source and waiting for you to clone, fork and build upon for your next React project.

Contributions via comments are welcome. The best ones will be moved into the article body and the link's `nofollow` removed.

# React

Application boilerplates for creating React applications.

- [react-starter-kit](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit) - Everything you need to build a front-end for a SEO-friendly React website. Supports text-only browsing and focuses heavily on Node.js and the surrounding ecosystem of NPM libraries.
- [re-base](https://github.com/tylermcginnis/re-base) - Inspired by Relay, combines the benefits of React and Firebase by allowing each component to specify its own data dependency. Forget about your data persistence and focus on what really matters, your application's state.
- [Este.js](https://github.com/este/este) - The most complete React/Flux dev stack and starter kit for universal functional web apps. Forget about evil frameworks, learn laser focused libraries and patterns instead.

# React Native

Application boilerplates for creating React Native applications.

- [react-native-webpack-server](https://github.com/mjohnston/react-native-webpack-server) - A development server that leverages the Webpack Dev Server and the React Packager to enable building React Native JavaScript bundles with webpack. This allows you to use the existing webpack ecosystem when targeting React Native.
- [react-native-es6-reflux](https://github.com/filp/react-native-es6-reflux) - Boilerplate for iOS app development with React Native, ES6 and Reflux
- [react-native-babel](https://github.com/roman01la/react-native-babel) - Configuration to build React Native apps with ES6 using webpack and Babel
