Not interested in reinventing the wheel? Neither am I. Here's a short list of awesome React boilerplates -- sometimes knows as starter kits, seeds or skeletons -- for getting React-based applications off the ground in a hurry. These application templates were not taken from any list, however <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome">awesome</a> that list might be. Rather, they've gained enough mindshare to find me outside [*The Stream*](https://medium.com/matter/the-web-we-have-to-save-2eb1fe15a426)[^1]. They're open source and waiting for you to clone, fork and build upon for your next React project.

# React

Application boilerplates for creating React apps.

**[react-redux-universal-hot-example](https://github.com/erikras/react-redux-universal-hot-example/)**
<br>A starter boilerplate for a universal webapp using express, react, redux, webpack, and react-transform

**[react-starter-kit](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit)**
<br>Everything you need to build a front-end for a SEO-friendly React website. Supports text-only browsing and focuses heavily on Node.js and the surrounding ecosystem of NPM libraries. For an example isomporhpic application I've built using this kit check out [lumpenradio-com](https://github.com/jhabdas/lumpenradio-com) or my [Isomporhpic Rendering with React](/talks/isomorphic-rendering-react/) talk.

**[react-redux-starter-kit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit)**
<br>By former colleague (and one hell of a coder) this kit is designed to get you up and running with a bunch of awesome new front-end technologies, all on top of a configurable, feature-rich webpack build system that's already setup to provide hot reloading, CSS modules with Sass support, unit testing, code coverage reports, bundle splitting, and a whole lot more.

**[react-slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot)**
<br>React Slingshot is a comprehensive starter kit for rapid application development using React. Includes React + Redux starter kit with Babel, hot reloading, testing, linting and a working example app, all built in.

**[hapi-universal-redux](https://github.com/luandro/hapi-universal-redux)**
<br>Isomorphic starter kit with server-side React rendering using npm, piping, webpack, webpack-dev-server, react-transform, hapi.js, babel.js, react.js, redux, redux-devtools, simple-redux-router, react-router, radium.

**[hapi-react-starter-kit](https://github.com/Dindaleon/hapi-react-starter-kit)**
<br>Another isomorphic boilerplate chalk full of features for the taking.

**[Este](https://github.com/este/este)**
<br>A React/Flux dev stack and starter kit for [Universal JavaScript apps](https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9). Renders pages <abbr title="Single Page App">SPA</abbr> style (using `script` tags) and, therefore, is not as SEO friendly as React Starter Kit.

**[re-base](https://github.com/tylermcginnis/re-base)**
<br>Inspired by Relay, combines the benefits of React and Firebase by allowing each component to specify its own data dependency. Forget about your data persistence and focus on what really matters, your application's state.

**[electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate)**
<br>Electron application boilerplate based on react, react-router, webpack, react-hot-loader for rapid application development

**[relay-starter-kit](https://github.com/relayjs/relay-starter-kit)**
<br>Barebones starting point for a Relay application. [Uses](https://github.com/relayjs/relay-starter-kit/blob/37f1d13613db732b2d924a55cecf89c255ce0f40/package.json#L14) the Babel Relay Plug-in and [linked to](https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/guides-babel-plugin.html#content) from the official Relay documentation so it's likely to gain traction as a starting point for new apps.

**[jspm-react](https://github.com/tinkertrain/jspm-react)**
<br>Configured starter repo to build web apps with React and ES6 modules using JSPM. Not actively maintained, though the author is still accepting pull requests.

# React Native

Application boilerplates for creating React Native applications.

**[pepperoni](http://getpepperoni.com/)**
<br>An aspirational open source starter for React Native and jam packed with lots of tasty ingredients.

**[react-native-webpack-starter-kit](https://github.com/jhabdas/react-native-webpack-starter-kit)**
<br>Build your React Native app with Webpack and Babel.

**[snowflake](https://github.com/bartonhammond/snowflake)**
<br>A React-Native starter kit using Redux, Parse.com, Jest

**[react-native-es6-babel](https://github.com/roman01la/react-native-babel)**
<br>Configuration to build React Native apps with ES6 using webpack and Babel

**[react-native-es6-reflux](https://github.com/filp/react-native-es6-reflux)**
<br>Boilerplate for iOS app development with React Native, ES6 and Reflux

**[react-native-tabbed](https://github.com/rxb/react-native-tabbed)**
<br>An unassumingly but sweet base for a native app with tabbed navigation and modal window support. Builds on the work of [`react-native-navbar`](https://github.com/Kureev/react-native-navbar). See it in use with [React Native Icons](https://github.com/corymsmith/react-native-icons) in my [Smartphone Symphony](https://github.com/jhabdas/SmartphoneSymphony) app.
