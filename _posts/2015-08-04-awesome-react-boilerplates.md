Not interested in reinventing the wheel? Neither am I. Here's a short list of awesome React boilerplates -- sometimes knows as starter kits, seeds or skeletons -- for getting React-based applications off the ground in a hurry. These application templates were not taken from any list, however awesome <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome">that list</a> might actually be. Rather, they've gained enough mindshare to find me outside [*The Stream*](https://medium.com/matter/the-web-we-have-to-save-2eb1fe15a426). They're open source and waiting for you to clone, fork and build upon for your next React project.

# React

Application boilerplates for creating React applications.

- [react-starter-kit](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit) - Everything you need to build a front-end for a SEO-friendly React website. Supports text-only browsing and focuses heavily on Node.js and the surrounding ecosystem of NPM libraries.
- [re-base](https://github.com/tylermcginnis/re-base) - Inspired by Relay, combines the benefits of React and Firebase by allowing each component to specify its own data dependency. Forget about your data persistence and focus on what really matters, your application's state.
- [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate) - Electron application boilerplate based on react, react-router, webpack, react-hot-loader for rapid application development
- [relay-starter-kit](https://github.com/relayjs/relay-starter-kit) - Barebones starting point for a Relay application. [Uses](https://github.com/relayjs/relay-starter-kit/blob/37f1d13613db732b2d924a55cecf89c255ce0f40/package.json#L14) the Babel Relay Plug-in and [linked to](https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/guides-babel-plugin.html#content) from the official Relay documentation so it's likely to gain traction as a starting point for new apps.
- [jspm-react](https://github.com/tinkertrain/jspm-react) - Configured starter repo to build web apps with React and ES6 modules

# React Native

Application boilerplates for creating React Native applications.

- [react-native-es6-babel](https://github.com/roman01la/react-native-babel) - Configuration to build React Native apps with ES6 using webpack and Babel
- [react-native-webpack-server](https://github.com/mjohnston/react-native-webpack-server) - A development server that leverages the Webpack Dev Server and the React Packager to enable building React Native JavaScript bundles with webpack. This allows you to use the existing webpack ecosystem when targeting React Native.
- [react-native-es6-reflux](https://github.com/filp/react-native-es6-reflux) - Boilerplate for iOS app development with React Native, ES6 and Reflux
