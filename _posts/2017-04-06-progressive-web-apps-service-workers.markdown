Wanted to quickly share a tutorial from Julian Gaviria about using [Lighthouse](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk) to benchmark [his JAMstack site](https://jamstack.org/examples/) to get it up to snuff with the latest and greatest from Google. To be able to do this, one must have HTTPS enabled on their website. Thankfully I've already written [a tutorial for that](/zero-to-http-2-aws-hugo/) to help get you started. Because they use fetch, I'm looking forward to seeing what them work alongside my new web performance library, [Fetch Inject](https://github.com/jhabdas/fetch-inject). Enjoy!
