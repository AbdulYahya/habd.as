One of the best parts of building with React is discovering new and awesome open source components to use. Rather than throwing the [kitchen](https://github.com/karl1992/awesome-react-components-all) [sink](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react#components) at you, here's a curated list of React components and component libraries I think are truly awesome.

Not sure where to start? Check out the list of [Awesome React Boilerplates](/awesome-react-boilerplates) for a solid footing for your React-based apps.

Contributions via comments welcome. The best React and React Native Components will be moved into the article body and the `nofollow` removed.

# React

Awesome components for building React apps.

**[Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/)**
<br>Short on design resources? Missing a style guide? No problem. With Material UI you can build and theme-roll an entire app without much of any design skills whatsoever, and still walk away looking like your right does more than fantasize about [retro gaming on an RPi](/ultima-underworld-on-rpi/).

**[React Flexbox Grid](https://github.com/roylee0704/react-flexbox-grid)**
<br>Though Material UI has a pretty stellar [Grid List component](http://www.material-ui.com/#/components/grid-list), it's not intended for layout. That's what Flexbox is for, bra. This component leverages CSS Modules, and pairs well with [Aphrodite](https://github.com/Khan/aphrodite) and Material UI for bulletproof responsive layouts.

**[PhotoSwipe](https://github.com/minhtranite/react-photoswipe)**
<br>Looking to create an engaging image gallery without going all-in on an [image gallery component](https://github.com/xiaolin/react-image-gallery)? Check out [PhotoSwipe](photoswipe.com), then install this gnarly react port for a superior image browsing UX for desktop and mobile.

_Thanks to [Anton Aleksandrov](https://github.com/anton-aleksandrov), creator of [Artsembler](https://artsembler.com/), for the suggestion._

**[Semantic UI React](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React)**
<br>I had the pleasure of working with [Levi Thomason](https://github.com/levithomason) on this project when it was still called Stardust. Like Material UI, Semantic UI is a great way to get a project to MVP without a designer. And though it wasn't built from the ground-up in React, like Material UI, it's now the official React port of Semantic UI and sure to continue gaining traction as time goes on.

**[React Native Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web)**
<br>From Nicolas Gallagher, creator of [SUIT CSS](https://suitcss.github.io/), this project aims to bring the power of React Native building blocks and touch handling to the Web. Forrealzies!

# React Native

Awesome components (native modules) for building React Native apps. All of which support both iOS and Android.

**[React Native Lock](https://auth0.com/lock)**
<br>From the team who brought us [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), the Lock component makes it simple to add authentication and password resets using email and social to your app. It even supports TouchID for iOS and can do Passwordless logins as well.

**[React Native Material Kit](https://github.com/xinthink/react-native-material-kit)**
<br>Furthest along in terms of bringing the beauty of [Material Design](https://material.google.com/) to React Native, though keep your eye on the [Material UI support issue](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/issues/593) for RN for updates as this space is fragmented for RN and several other Material kits exist (though none are nearly as good).

**[React Native Router Flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux/)**
<br>Routing in RN is, ahem, a bit of suck. In fact, there are [several ways to do navigation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigation.html) in RN core. Instead of rolling your own, use this router -- which integrates easily with Redux and will help you better manage your application state and overall composition.

**[React Native Vector Icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons)**
<br>No app is complete without some glamorous iconography. Install this module for access to over 3000 vector icons from several different icon sets, including [Material Icons](https://design.google.com/icons/).

**[React Native Video](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-video)**
<br>Looking to add a fullscreen video background to your RN app? Here's your ticket. From [Brent Vatne](https://github.com/brentvatne), creator of [Exponent](https://www.getexponent.com/), this native module--now a part of a collective group of components managed by the React Native Community--makes it a cinch to enable stunning visual effects in your app.
