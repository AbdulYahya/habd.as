Starting today [habd.as](#) no longer tracks visitors using JavaScript. What this means is that you can browse this website with [Yandex.Browser](https://browser.yandex.com/) or [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/en/) and not see any trackers show up. There may be an exception or two for older posts with YouTube video embeds though all existing known trackers have been removed and any others uncovered will be removed on a go-forward basis. I’m doing this out of respect for individual privacy and to raise awareness of tracking on the Web.

What I’m giving up to make this possible:

- The potential to serve JS-based ads on this website. I never cared much for ads. They’re annoying. I’m sure we can agree.
- Analytics data using Google Analytics. Google has enough data already. They don’t need ours too.

What I’ve gained in return:

- I nuked the Privacy Policy I was maintaining on this website as it’s no longer necessary.
- Removing the Privacy Policy opened up enough space in the page footer for me to link to this site’s source code.

I respect your privacy on the Web. Please browse responsibly.
