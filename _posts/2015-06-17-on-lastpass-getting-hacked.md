I've long encouraged individuals to use a password manager. While I was working my first job out of college, before smartphones as we know them today even existed, I worked for a company that had decentralized authorization to pretty much all of their systems. Lotus Notes, Mainframe, Exchange and some other internal tools all required their own passwords from users, each on a rotating password policy — requiring employees change their passwords every 90 days.

This incumbent task became quite problematic, I noticed, for security. Many users would simply choose something easy to remember and rotate the last 3-4 digits with a rolling number such as `dictionaryattack234`. A password manager wasn’t something most people thought about. And when faced with managing a set of passwords across systems, keeping them all in sync was oftentimes arduous or simply not possible without one.

It was around that time I started using a password manager called PassKeeper. The program was a minimalistic, fully keyboard accessible C-based GUI editor with list view — and it continued to run on pretty much every version of Windows ever made. I used it for 10 years and only ever saw one bug, and it was merely visual. I [advocated use of PassKeeper to others](/password-protection-with-passkeeper/), both for better security as well as general time savings.

When I joined my second company their security systems were better, but a new problem arose: they gave me a Mac and I bought [my first smartphone](/running-android-on-htc-hd2-leo/). Now I was running two operating systems which wouldn’t support my favorite Borland-compiled security util. So I switched to a keyboard-accessible cross-platform tool called KeePassX and again [advocated its use](/managing-passwords-on-android/).

Before switching to KeePassX I took a quick survey of password management tools and looked at what most others were doing at my company—they were using 1Password and they paid for it. But not me.

Being a bit frugal and knowing I could successfully manage my passwords without paying I considered what it meant to not only store all your eggs in one basket, but to use a service which stored all the collectives eggs together. The set-up seemed like a security anti-pattern in an of itself. Which is why I’m glad I never chose it.

At my last company a junior engineer posed the question of how best to manage passwords and, much to my chagrin, was given advice to use LastPass. After offering my concern with the security model I advocated use of KeePassX to the individual. Now I’m not sure if that individual ever used it—it’s certainly not the sexiest tool—but as millions of LastPass users ponder their online security this week I hope all those who decided pay for LastPass learned a valuable lesson about security on the Internet. And that each individual take advantage of the free credit monitoring owed them as a result of the recent security breach at LastPass.

Now the term LastPass may connote something entirely different as many of its users search for a more secure alternative.
